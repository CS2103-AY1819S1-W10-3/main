== Introduction

EventOrganiser is an application for managing and organising events built for NUS students.
More importantly, EventOrganiser is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
If you can type fast, EventOrganiser can help you to arrange events faster than traditional GUI apps.

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `addressbook.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Address Book.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`listUser`* : lists all users in the event organiser
* **`addUser`**`n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : creates a new user named `John Doe` to the Event Organiser.
* `addEvent n/CS2103 Project Meeting a/SoC Canteen t/Urgent` : adds an event named CS2103 Project Meeting to be held at SoC Canteen.
* *`exit`* : exits the app

To use the application, you must first create an account using the `addUser` command, and then login.
You may then decide to organise an event using the `addEvent` command, to which you can specify the date, time and create polls.
Alternatively, you may decide to search for an event to join, and then vote in the event polls.

*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
