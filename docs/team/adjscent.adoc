== PROJECT: EventOrganiser

---

== Overview

[https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-W10-3/main[EventOrganiser]] is a desktop event organiser book application used to store personal particulars and organise events and for other users to join the event as event participants.The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

This project portfolio summarizes the contributions that I have done to the EventOrganiser.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to manage schedule*
** What it does: allows the user to manage their schedule inside the event organiser
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user is able to find out the vacant time slots of every person, so that he can plan the event time with more considerations.
** Highlights: It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. There is a need to choose a tradeoff between ease of management vs schedule detail or else the performance of the event organiser will suffer.

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to download timetable from NUSmods, which is then converted to a schedule*
** What it does: allows the user to quickly download his timetable from NUSmods to be used in the event organiser
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because this provides a convenient way for users to add their schedules automatically and quickly
** Highlights: The implementation  was challenging as it required reading of documentation and analysing how nusmods handles external api requests (valid and invalid)
** Credits: JSON Reference from [https://github.com/nusmodifications/nusmods-api[NusMods API]]

* *Minor enhancement*: added a schedule comparison command that allows the user to compare multiple schedules to get the possible free slots.

* *Code contributed*: [https://nus-cs2103-ay1819s1.github.io/cs2103-dashboard/#=undefined&search=adjscent&sort=displayName&since=2018-09-12&until=2018-11-06&timeframe=day&reverse=false&repoSort=true[Functional code]]
