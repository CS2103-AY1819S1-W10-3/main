== PROJECT: EventOrganiser

---

== Overview

EventOrganiser is an application for managing and organising events built for NUS students. It is optimized for those
who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

== Summary of

* *Major enhancement*: Added the ability to specify friendships among users
** What it does: Allows the users to add or delete friends with each other and have their friend lists displayed
** Justification: This feature allows users to keep a friendship list which they can refer to it themselves when creating new events. For example, if they would like to organize a friends meetup, they will know who to add to the event. Also, it allows users to search for friends with common interests and expand their friendship lists.

* *Minor enhancement*: Added a new attribute Interest for a user
** Justification: This attribute allows users to specify any number of interests, which can be identified for friendships and events.
